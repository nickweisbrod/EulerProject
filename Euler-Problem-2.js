//********** PROBLEM 2 **********
//Even Fibonacci numbers

//Each new term in the Fibonacci sequence is generated by adding 
//the previous two terms. By starting with 1 and 2, the first 10 
//terms will be: 1, 2, 3, 5, 8, 13, 21, 34, 55, 89, ...

//By considering the terms in the Fibonacci sequence whose values 
//do not exceed four million, find the sum of the even-valued terms.
